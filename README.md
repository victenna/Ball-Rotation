A mini-project for kids who are interested in Python programming. The project was created using the Python
Pygame library. This basic code demonstrates the animation of the balls that are rotating with different speeds.
A simple code shows how to use the Pygame library to download an image into the program, set an image to a given
point on the coordinate plane, implement image rotation without moving of the image along the coordinate axes. 
The files for modeling this scenario can be downloaded free of charge at:
